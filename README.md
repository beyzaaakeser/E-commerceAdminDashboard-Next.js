<h1>My Ecommerce Admin Dashboard App - NextJs & TypeScript</h1>

This e-commerce admin dashboard application is a management panel developed using modern web technologies and libraries. While a powerful and fast user experience is provided thanks to React and Next.js, a dynamic and responsive interface is provided with Tailwind CSS.

On the homepage of the application, there is a summary view where the admin can manage users, sales, and products.
Thanks to the interactive charts created with the Chart.js and React-Chartjs-2 libraries, data such as total sales amounts, sales prices, and number of products sold can be accessed visually.

The admin can list products, add new products, and update or delete existing products. The admin can view the information of all users registered in the system. A detail mode has been created for users, and the admin can access more information about a user. If necessary, a user can be removed from the system. On the Orders page, the purchase date, delivery address, and status of the ordered products (for example, "Ordered" or "Delivered") are managed in detail.
This admin panel was developed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing the background of an e-commerce project.
